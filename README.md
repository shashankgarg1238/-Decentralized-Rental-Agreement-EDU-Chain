# Decentralized Rental Agreement

## 🧾 Project Description
The **Decentralized Rental Agreement** is a blockchain-based solution designed to make rental processes secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, this smart contract automates rental payments, manages deposits, and enforces rental terms without requiring third-party intermediaries.

## 🌐 Project Vision
Our vision is to **digitally transform rental agreements** using smart contracts — reducing fraud, increasing transparency, and empowering both landlords and tenants with a trustless system that operates on code and consensus rather than paperwork and middlemen.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Landlord-Tenant Agreement**: Allows landlords to create contracts and tenants to sign them by sending rent + deposit.
- **Automated Payment Transfer**: Rent is transferred to the landlord automatically upon agreement signing.
- **Deposit Handling**: Security deposits are held in the contract and refunded to the tenant once the rental period ends.
- **Time-Based Logic**: Rental duration is enforced using block timestamps to prevent premature termination.
- **Public Record**: All transactions and contract status are transparently available on the blockchain.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Support for **monthly rent cycles** and automated recurring payments.
- **Dispute resolution mechanism** in case of disagreement at the end of the contract.
- Integration with **decentralized identity systems (DIDs)** for verified users.
- A **user-friendly frontend DApp** for easier interactions.
- Option to upload agreement PDFs/IPFS documents linked to the contract.
